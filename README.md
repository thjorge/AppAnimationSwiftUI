# AppAnimationSwiftUI

The lectures for the Spring 2020 version of Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI) were delivered to our students in an on-line fashion due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.  Stanford has made these lecture videos available to all by posting them on its YouTube channel (links below).  This website was set up to give everyone access to the supporting material that was distributed to students during the quarter (homework, demo code, etc.).
